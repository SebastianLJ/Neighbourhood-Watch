# Neighborhood Watch Alarm System
The Neighborhood Watch Alarm System is a LoRa-based home security system.
The system is split into two: 
  - A server placed centrally in a neighborhood
  - Alarms that can be installed in the home.
  
## Installation
An installation guide and developer wiki are underway.

## Contributing
The project is not quite ready for contributions, but will be by the end of June 2020.
