# Neighborhood Watch Alarm (NWA)
NWA is an open source neighborhood security movement with an alarm system that anyone can assemble and manage locally. NWA is published under the [MIT License](https://github.com/neighborhood-watch-alarm/nwa/blob/master/LICENSE).

The client-server system consists of Arduino-based **alarms** outfitted with sensors, and a Raspberry Pi **server**. The devices communicate via LoRa signals and a TTN Gateway. The server sends text-messages when an alarm is triggered.

For general and installation related information, please see the [**main site**](https://nwa-site.herokuapp.com/).

For system details and architecture descriptions, please see the [wiki](https://github.com/neighborhood-watch-alarm/nwa/wiki).
